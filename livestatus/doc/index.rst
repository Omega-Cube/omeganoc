  * Jump back to :ref:`Livestatus module configuration <the_broker_modules>`


What is it 
-----------


Livestatus API is the modern method of interacting with Shinken and Nagios based systems alike.

Originally developed for Nagios, MK Livetstatus, was re-implemented in Python for use with Shinken by professional developers. The access methods and query languages are the same.

Why use it 
-----------


It is fast.

It is network based using TCP.

It is standard for all Nagios and Shinken monitoring systems.

It uses in-memory structures for status data

It uses a back-end database for historical reporting

It uses an SQL based query language

It has a host of powerful nuts and bolts features (authentication, caching, connection persistence, multiple object methods (JSON, Python)).


What can I do with it? 
-----------------------


All programs and scripts use (or should use) this method to :

  * Obtain the current state of hosts and services
  * Obtain the current configuration related to hosts and services
  * Send administrative commands (downtimes, comments, forcing checks)
  * Filter information to display
  * Obtain basic reports and event statistics

Shinken being a modern re-implementation of Nagios has additional features that are available in addition to the standard Livestatus API.

Shinken Livestatus API unique features can :
  * Obtain Business Impact information
  * Obtain intelligent dependency status hosts or services (combines dependency and parent information)
  * Obtain Business Process states (same syntax as standard host and service queries)


How does it work
