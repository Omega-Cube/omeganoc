### Gunicorn server configuration
# Hokuto pages are delivered by a standalone Gunicorn server by default.
# You can configure this server here by defining configuration directives 
# starting with "GUNICORN_" and ending by the name of the Gunicorn directive 
# you want to set. Gunicorn settings are documented here:
# http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/settings.html
# Note that the Gunicorn pidfile setting will be automatically
# set to this file's PIDFILE value
# If you do not wish to use Gunicorn, you may disable it by setting 
# ENABLE_GUNICORN to False. Only do this if you know what you're doing however,
# as the web server will not automatically start by itself in that case.
[config]
ENABLE_GUNICORN=True

# This should be set to the server's listening address and port
GUNICORN_BIND=0.0.0.0:5555

# Set this value to specify the number of worker processes for handling requests
# Default is 1
#GUNICORN_WORKERS=4

# Runs gunicorn detached from the launching terminal
GUNICORN_DAEMON=True

# User and group used to run the server's worker processes
GUNICORN_USER=shinken
GUNICORN_GROUP=shinken

### Flask configuration

# Set this directive if the website is assigned to a specific domain
#SERVER_NAME=omeganoc.myserver.com:5000

# Server's secret key use to encrypt things
SECRET_KEY=\xfb\x12\xdf\xa1@i\xd6>V\xc0\xbb\x8fp\x16#Z\x0b\x81\xeb\x16
