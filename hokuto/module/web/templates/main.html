<h1>Welcome to Hokuto</h1>
<p>This interface is still in an early stage of development. We've put the minimum amount of features for this to have some usefulness,
and plan to keep on coding, so please bear with us while we fix and enhance stuff !</p>

<h2>Your first steps with Hokuto (for the main admin)</h2>
<p>If you're the admin, before you do anything, make sure you go to your profile and associate your account 
to the appropriate Shinken contact. It is set to <em>admin</em> by default, so be sure to change it if you
removed the default admin contact from shinken. <b>Hokuto users can only see components that are linked to 
their shinken contact</b>.</p>
<p>Of course you can also create other users and associate them to other contacts, so they can see 
another subset of your shinken data.</p>

<h2>So what can you do with this ?</h2>
<p>At the top right corner of the page, you'll find a list of currently active warnings and errors.</p>
<p><b>The Dashboards page</b> allows you to create dashboards to display data from the components monitored by shinken; 
their metrics data, their events, as well as SLA statistics.</p>
<p><b>The Graph page</b> allows you to quickly visualize the components monitored by shinken and their relations with a dynamic,
customizable graph system. The physical graph is designed to show physical servers, with their network relationships 
(as defined by Shinken's "parent" link). The logical graphs shows the hosts and services, and logical links between them 
(as defined by Shinken's service dependencies). You can also create your own link to create visual clues about relations 
that you did not want to declare in Shinken's configuration, by clicking on a service and gragging from the link button to 
another service. All elements on the graph view will get colored yellow or red, so you can have a clear view of your 
systems and the elements impacted by errors and warnings. And don't forget to check the menu at the top left of the page !</p>
<p>Note that your dashboards and graph layouts are your own: every user has his own separate save files.</p>

<h2>Prediction system</h2>
<p>A first look at our predictive system is also available in this release, in the form of <em>Nanto</em>, a separate Shinken plugin that
will regularily try to compute projected values for all of your probes in the next few hours. The results will show in 
the dashboard's charts. Note however that we need around two full weeks of past data before you will start getting results,
and that you may need to wait a few hours before the first batch of results come in.</p>
