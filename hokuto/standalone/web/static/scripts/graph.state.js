// OmegaNoc.GraphState
// Contains code that allows the developer to save and restore 
// a graph's state on the server.
//
// Use the load function to load a graph data
// Use the save data to save data.
//
// Note that saving data does not happen the moment you call the save function.
// A small delay is applied before actually sending the new values to the server,
// in order to avoid too many repeated save requests when the user applies many little
// changes in a short amount of time.
// The actual server call for saving is made after a small amount of inactivity time
// (time spent without calling save), and will send all the data contained in all the save
// calls made since the last save was sent to the server.

// If you want to force sending all saving data to the server (for example because the page
// will be closed), call the flush function.
